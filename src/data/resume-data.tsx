  about:
    "Senior Frontend Engineer focused on building blazingly fast and scalable web apps and sites",
  summary: `For more than 6 years of my career, I have been working in such roles as a frontend engineer, and full-stack engineer, and I also have partially been leading a team of up to 3 people. I have completed multiple projects in different domains, helping to understand, improve, and fulfill business requirements. Sharing my knowledge and experience to help people around grow. I like to work closely with the team and tackle user's problems. My tech expertise is concentrated on serverless web technologies, including all the pieces necessary to complete the end-to-end development cycle. My go-to choice is next.js, although I like to try other technologies for specific tasks. Writing articles and open-sourcing.
